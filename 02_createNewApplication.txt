Create a New Application

When creating a new Appsmith account, an application titled 'My first application' is automatically added under the default Workspace.

You can use this application to build your first app or create a new one by clicking on the + New button under the Workspace.

Hover over the 'My first application' card and click the Edit button to open the application.

You'll land on the Appsmith editor. Select the Build with drag & drop option to start from scratch and create your custom UI.
