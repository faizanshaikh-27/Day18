Appsmith is an open source, low code developer tool that helps the rapid creation of internal applications.

You can drag, and drop pre-built widgets to build UI on a grid-style canvas.

Appsmith simplifies frontend and back-end integration between the UI and the datasource to optimize building applications.

Appsmith supports JavaScript inside widgets, queries, and almost any other component to add logic, transform data, and define complex workflows.


Why Appsmith
1. Connect Datasource: Integrate with a datasource such as a database or an API. Appsmith has plug-and-play support for many databases.

2. Build UI: Use customizable built-in widgets to build an app layout.

3. Access Data: Connect UI to the datasource by writing queries and binding the data to widgets. Control everything with JavaScript.

4. Collaborate, Deploy, Share: Appsmith also supports version control with Git to track changes, create rollbacks and collaborate using git branches. Deploy the app and share it with other users.
